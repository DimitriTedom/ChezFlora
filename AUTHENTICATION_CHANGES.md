# Authentication Flow Changes - ChezFlora 🌸

## Problem Solved ✅

**Previous Issue**: Users were forced to authenticate before seeing any products or browsing the website.

**Solution**: Modified the authentication flow to allow public browsing while requiring authentication only for specific actions.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated CheckAuth Component** (`/client/src/components/Common/Check-auth.tsx`)
- Added `requireAuth` prop to make authentication optional
- Users can now browse public routes without authentication
- Only redirects to login when `requireAuth=true`
- Improved root path redirection logic

### 2. **Created ProtectedRoute Component** (`/client/src/components/Common/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)
- New component specifically for routes that require authentication
- Automatically redirects to login with return URL
- Handles admin access control

### 3. **Updated Main Routing** (`/client/src/Home.tsx`)
- **Public Routes** (no authentication required):
  - `/shop/home` - Homepage
  - `/shop/store` - Product catalog
  - `/shop/detail/:id` - Product details
  - `/shop/about` - About page
  - `/shop/search` - Search functionality
  - `/shop/contact` - Contact page

- **Protected Routes** (authentication required):
  - `/shop/checkout` - Checkout process
  - `/shop/account` - User account management
  - `/shop/quotes` - Quote requests
  - `/shop/my-bookings` - User bookings

### 4. **Enhanced Login Component** (`/client/src/pages/Auth/Login.tsx`)
- Added support for return URLs via `?returnTo=` query parameter
- Users are redirected back to their intended page after login
- Improved user experience with proper navigation flow

### 5. **Updated Shopping Headers** 
- **Desktop Header** (`/client/src/components/Shopping-view/Header.tsx`):
  - Cart icon shows login prompt for unauthenticated users
  - Only fetches cart data for authenticated users
  - Graceful handling of missing user data

- **Mobile Header** (`/client/src/components/Shopping-view/HeaderSm.tsx`):
  - Similar cart functionality for mobile users
  - Login redirection for cart access

### 6. **Enhanced Product Detail Page** (`/client/src/pages/Shopping-view/ShoppingProductDetail.tsx`)
- "Add to Cart" button now shows login prompt for unauthenticated users
- Preserves the product page URL for post-login redirection
- Better user feedback with toast messages

## User Experience Flow

2. ✅ **Can search products** - Use search functionality
3. ✅ **Can view product details** - See full product information, reviews, etc.
